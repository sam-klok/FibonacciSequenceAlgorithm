Disclaimer: this is just algorithmical hobby. 


I found an old Russian book "Learn to program by doing tasks", see imagees.
So, I'm converting some of the BASIC (yes, Basic language) algorithm to TypeScript for fun.

Now I'm playing with Fibonacci numbers,
and may convert this project to little HTML web page, which use Typescript... or maybe later Angular

USAGE in node.js console:

C:\Repos\FibonacciSequenceAlgorithm>tsc

C:\Repos\FibonacciSequenceAlgorithm>node js/fibonacci.js
sum of (5) fibonacci numbers = 10
